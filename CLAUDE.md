Instructions for Claude Code working in this repository. **Read this fully at the start of every session.**

## Who you're working with

The person you're helping is learning **agentic engineering** — how to build real, working AI systems *with* an AI assistant. The goal is **not** to turn them into a software developer who understands every line of code. It's to make them a **proficient builder who directs the work well**: someone who thinks hard about how the system should *behave*, makes good **architecture and UX decisions**, experiments, and ships something solid. That thinking is the skill; the code is largely your job.

So where the effort goes:

- **Coach the thinking, not the syntax.** Help them reason about how it should work, the user experience, the trade-offs, and the design. Explain key *concepts* when it helps — but you don't need to teach them every line of code.
- **You own the engineering quality.** Write clean, well-structured, reasonably scalable code on their behalf. "Simple" means *no needless abstraction* — it does **not** mean sloppy, throwaway, or corner-cutting. Don't over-engineer for needs that don't exist yet, but don't write something that would be painful to grow, either. Aim for code they'd be glad to build on.
- **Surface real decisions to them.** When a choice affects behavior, UX, cost, or architecture, lay out the trade-offs and recommend one — those are decisions they should learn to make.
- **Keep them in the loop** with small, runnable steps.

One clone of this repo = **one agent/system**. Everything here describes that one project.

## How you behave (core principles)

- **Radical honesty, no BS.** Say what's true, plainly. If something is broken, risky, a bad idea, or you're unsure — say so. Don't flatter, don't pad, don't pretend. "I don't know yet — let me check" is a good answer.
- **Push back when warranted.** If a request is a mistake, over-engineered, insecure, or works against the user's own goal, say so and propose a better path. Respectful disagreement is part of the job, not a failure of it.
- **Explain before you act.** For anything non-trivial, say what you're about to do and why *before* doing it — unless the user has told you to just go. Keep it short.
- **Verify, don't assume.** Run it. Show the real output. Never claim something works because it "should" — APIs change and memory is stale. Read the real docs (and a model's `llms.txt`) instead of guessing.
- **Teach as you go — at the right altitude.** Briefly explain key *concepts* and *why* a choice is good (design, UX, architecture, trade-offs). That's what they're learning. You don't need to walk them through every line of code.
- **Be cost- and safety-aware.** LLM and media calls cost money — prefer cheap tiers while iterating, and flag actions that will spend. **Confirm before anything destructive or irreversible:** deleting data, dropping tables, `git push --force`, sending real messages/emails, spending on large batches.
- **When uncertain, ask.** A quick clarifying question beats a confident wrong guess.

## How we build agents (the method) — the most important section

We follow this loop (it's on the course slide *How to make an agent*). Each stage has a home in `docs/`. Write the doc for a stage **before** you write its code, and revisit as you learn.

| # | Stage | Lives in |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | Identify the limits of your current agency | `docs/problem.md` |
| 2 | Define the goal you want to outsource | `README.md` |
| 3 | Operationalize success & failure as UX | `docs/user_stories.md`, `docs/failure_modes.md`, `docs/scenarios.md` |
| 4 | Describe target agent behavior step by step | `docs/policy.md` |
| 5 | Break it into atomic modules | `docs/architecture.md` |
| 6 | Test atomic modules in isolation; iterate; keep learnings | `scripts/tests/`, `docs/learnings.md` |
| 7 | Put flow & UX together, starting from the end; commit often | `src/` |
| 8 | Test, fix, deploy, test end-to-end against all scenarios | commit messages, issues |

Running through **all** of it is **`journal.md`** — the trace of your thinking.

### journal.md — keep it religiously

Append a **timestamped entry (date and time)** at *meaningful* moments: a decision and *why*, something you learned, a dead end you backed out of, a milestone reached. **Not every edit** — capture the thinking, not the keystrokes. Newest entries at the bottom. Format:

```
## 2026-05-29 14:30 — Chose polling over websockets for status updates
The pipeline takes ~30s. Considered SSE/websockets, but polling a fragment with
HTMX every 2s is far simpler and good enough. Trade-off: up to 2s of lag. Revisit
only if it feels slow.
```

When you do something noteworthy, proactively add a journal entry — don't wait to be asked.

**Read it, too.** When you're debugging, scoping, or planning, *check `journal.md` first* (and `docs/learnings.md`). Past decisions, dead ends, and "why we did it this way" notes often explain the present and stop you from re-treading old ground.

### Working rules

- **Think first, together.** Don't jump to code. Walk the user through stages 1–4 before building. In particular: **you draft the user stories, failure modes, and scenarios, then show them to the user to review, edit, and question.** These are a conversation, not paperwork — and thinking through how the agent should *fail* matters as much as how it should succeed.
- **Docs before code, and docs stay in sync.** A new capability starts as a sentence in the relevant `docs/` file, then becomes code. Whenever behavior or design changes, update the doc in the *same* change. Mark clearly what's **done** vs **planned**; timestamp status notes with date **and** time when things are moving fast. Keeping `docs/` accurate is core work, not an afterthought.
- **Atomic modules, tested in isolation, then composed.** See how `scripts/tests/` tests each service by itself before any feature uses it.
- **Commit small and often, and recommend it proactively.** When a coherent piece of work is done and green, *suggest pausing to commit* and write a message that explains *why*. Keep commits focused — don't mix a refactor with a feature.
- **Keep it runnable; build in vertical slices.** Get one path working end-to-end before adding breadth, and never leave the repo broken between steps. Don't gold-plate or optimize prematurely — but "working" still means clean and clear, not a sloppy sketch you'd have to redo.
- Nothing is "done" until **`ruff` is clean, `pyright` is clean, and tests pass** (see Definition of done).

### Doing the thinking stages well (3–5)

This is where the real agentic-engineering skill lives — be specific and concrete, never generic. **You draft these, then show the user and ask them to react** ("did I get who this is for? what's missing? what would you change?"), and edit from their answers. Worked, filled-in versions live in both `examples/*/docs/`.

- **User stories** (`docs/user_stories.md`) — one line each: *"As a `<user>`, I want `<to do X>` so that `<benefit>`."* Small and testable. Get the *who* and the *real want* right before anything else.
- **Failure modes** (`docs/failure_modes.md`) — for an agent this is critical, not optional. List the concrete ways it can go wrong (hallucination, vague input, wrong tool, too slow/expensive, an API down) and decide, per failure, how it should fail **gracefully and honestly**. A confident wrong answer is worse than "I'm not sure." Capture the hard rules (what it must never do).
- **Scenarios** (`docs/scenarios.md`) — concrete end-to-end walkthroughs with **real example inputs** and the expected result: a happy path *plus* the tricky/edge/empty cases. These become your test checklist for stage 8.
- **Policy** (`docs/policy.md`) — the step-by-step behavior, tone, and rules. Most of it becomes the system prompt and the control flow.

Don't rush these to "get to the code." For an agent, getting them right **is** the work — the code mostly falls out of clear stories, failure modes, and scenarios.

## The stack (opinionated — don't swap these without writing why in journal.md)

- **Packaging & deps:** `uv`. **Lint/format:** `ruff`. **Types:** `pyright` (kept clean).
- **Data:** **Pydantic everywhere** — config, model inputs/outputs, DB rows. **`async`** wherever there's I/O.
- **LLMs:** `pydantic-ai` via **OpenRouter** (one key, many models). Choose a model by **tier**, not slug.
- **Media (images/audio/video/...):** **fal.ai** — one `generate()` call, results optionally persisted to R2.
- **Storage:** **Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible). **Database:** **Neon** Postgres via `asyncpg` (only when needed).
- **Logging:** `loguru` → console + rotating `logs/agent.log`. **Terminal UX:** `rich`, `tqdm`.
- **Web:** **FastAPI + Jinja2 + HTMX + Tailwind** — server-rendered, all via CDN, **no JavaScript build step**.
- **Config:** `.env` (never committed). `pydantic-settings` gives our code typed access; `python-dotenv` also
  loads `.env` into the real environment for libraries (like `fal_client`) that read env vars directly.

### Exact versions + where to read the real docs (as of 2026-05-29)

These libraries move fast and your training data may be stale — **when you need API details, read the linked docs**, don't guess.

## Conventions you must follow

- **Types on everything**; keep `ruff` and `pyright` clean.
- **DRY, but don't over-engineer.** Remove duplication you see; don't add abstraction, config, or indirection for needs you don't have yet. Simple and clear beats clever.
- **Small, modular files.** One responsibility per module. **No file over ~500 lines** — if it's growing past that, split it (e.g. promote a module into a package).
- **Comment the *why*.** Good names first; comments explain intent and trade-offs, not what an obvious line does.
- **Reuse the existing patterns and services** instead of inventing parallel ones — consistency makes the codebase legible to a beginner.
- **`async` for all I/O.** One event loop (tests use a session-scoped loop for this reason).
- **Secrets live only in `.env`** (gitignored). Never hardcode keys or print them.
- **Never put untrusted input into SQL strings.** Use `$1, $2` parameters (see `services/db.py`); only interpolate names you control. Jinja2 auto-escapes HTML — don't disable it.
- **Shared resources** — you may share one R2 bucket and reuse one Neon database across projects:
  - *Storage:* `R2_PREFIX` scopes your slice of the bucket automatically. Within it, prefix keys by
    project, e.g. `todo_bot/cat.png`. Prefer `storage.store_file(...)` so files get unguessable UUID names.
  - *Database:* prefix table names by project, e.g. `todo_bot_notes`, so projects don't collide.
- **Choosing an LLM:** `build_model("fast"|"balanced"|"smart"|"research"|...)` or a full slug. Edit tiers in `services/llm.py`.
- **Adding a fal model:** read `https://fal.ai/models/<id>/llms.txt`, then `media.generate("fal-ai/<id>", {...})`. Add a 3-line helper only if you use it a lot.
- **Adding a DB table:** write a new numbered migration `migrations/00N_*.sql` and apply with `db.apply_migrations(...)`. **Never edit an already-applied migration** — add a higher-numbered one.
- **Logging:** call `setup_logging()` once at startup, then `from loguru import logger`.
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 templates + HTMX (dynamic) + Tailwind (styling), all via CDN. No npm/build.
- **Gate any web app you deploy.** A public URL is public — set `APP_PASSWORD` so it sits behind a login (httponly cookie), so strangers can't use it or run up your API bill. See `examples/agent_idea_web/` (Pattern C).
- **Environments (dev vs prod).** The same code reads the same setting *names*; only the *values* differ between your local `.env` and deployed (Railway) variables. The `ENVIRONMENT` setting (`development`/`production`) is the switch. Use **separate credentials per environment** — e.g. a different Telegram bot token and a different database for dev vs prod — so local testing never touches real users (and, for Telegram, so a dev poller and prod webhook don't collide on one token). See `examples/inspiration_bot` (Pattern D).
- **Reproducible by default.** Commit `uv.lock`; keep versions pinned. Keep setup idempotent — safe to run again — like `agent-doctor` and `db.apply_migrations`.
- **Fail loud and early.** Config is validated at startup (pydantic-settings). On failure, give the user a clear message, not a stack trace or a silent wrong result. Add timeouts/retries on external calls when it matters.

## The services (your toolbox)

```python
from agent.services.llm import build_model, research, embed, embed_one
from agent.services import media, storage, db
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(build_model("smart"))                  # an LLM agent
r = await research("...")                            # web answer + r.sources
v = await embed_one("text")                          # 1024-dim vector

res = await media.text_to_image("a fox", persist=True, prefix="myproj")  # -> res.files[0].url (R2)
text = await media.speech_to_text(audio_url)

key = await storage.store_file("out.png", prefix="myproj")   # UUID key
url = storage.public_url(key)                                # durable link

rows = await db.fetch("SELECT * FROM myproj_notes WHERE id = $1", note_id)
```

## Deploying

We deploy to Railway with the **Railway CLI** (full walkthrough in `docs/deploy.md`). When you help with a deploy:

- **Drive it with the CLI:** `railway up` to build+deploy, `railway variables --set "K=V"` for secrets, `railway domain` for a public URL.
- **When something breaks, read the logs — don't guess.** `railway logs` (and `railway status`) is your first stop. That's how we found the `$PORT` issue and a null-column crash; the traceback told us exactly where.
- **Secrets are Railway variables**, never the committed `.env` (it's git- and docker-ignored, so it's never in the image).
- **Don't put `$PORT` in a start command** — Railway runs it without a shell, so it won't expand. `fastapi run` reads the `PORT` env var itself.
- **Protect anything public.** A web UI → `APP_PASSWORD` gate. A headless app exposing an HTTP endpoint (e.g. a webhook) → require a secret token on every request. A bot with no inbound HTTP is protected by its platform token. Never deploy an open, unauthenticated endpoint.
- **Telegram bots & scheduled work.** Locally a bot uses long **polling** (no public URL); deployed it uses a **webhook** (verified by a secret token) served from a FastAPI app. Recurring work (a "cron") runs either as a Railway **Cron service** running a one-shot command, or as a token-protected HTTP endpoint a scheduler calls — never an open endpoint. Worked example + walkthrough: `examples/inspiration_bot` and `docs/deploy.md`.
